This will leave you only with very limited amount of items and only clean style and only default soundtrack.  
Point of this package removal is so you are able to export packs really quickly using the beemod's export
#### if you want to be able to just run beemod, you can leave only `clean_style.bee_pack` and `music.bee_pack`

# tips on how to do it properly:

2) backup your original packages folder
